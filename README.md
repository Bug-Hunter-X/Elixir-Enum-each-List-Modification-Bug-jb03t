This example demonstrates a common misunderstanding in Elixir when working with list manipulation within Enum.each.  The provided code attempts to remove the element '3' from a list during iteration.  However, Elixir's immutability means the original list remains unchanged, highlighting the need for alternative approaches to modify lists effectively.
